<div class="answer" id="answer2" style="display: none;">

<b>Correct Answer: B. Donations are typically processed in an unsecured location by staff and volunteers. At best, many nonprofits process large amounts of cash and checks in a back room at a bank, which is fairly secure but rarely guarded.</b>

<em>CDS Global ensures donations are processed in a secured location with 24-hour video surveillance by professionals using automated equipment and manual processors that capture all related data and eliminate errors.</em>

What is the industry standard for how much time passes between the time a nonprofit processes a gift and the time that they send out an acknowledgement?
<ol>
	<li>1 week</li>
	<li>No more than 2 weeks</li>
	<li class="answer_correct">2-4 weeks</li>

What is the industry standard as to how nonprofitsâ€™ gift documents (checks, donation slips, etc.) are archived and stored? And how long does it take to make this happen?
<ol>
	<li class="answer_correct">Checks are scanned by a bank. This is done anywhere from 24 hours to 6 weeks from receipt of donation.</li>
	<li>All documents are scanned and stored electronically in archive. This is done immediately upon the deposit of the check.</li>

</ol>
<div class="submit_answer">Check Answer</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer5" style="display: none;">

<b>Correct Answer: A. Checks are typically scanned by a bank and archived at the bank with limited access for the nonprofit. Checks are copied to paper and filed with accompanying information in vertical files for seven years and then destroyed. This leaves much to be desired in terms of access and location in case of questions by donors and/or auditors. This is done anywhere from 24 hours to 6 weeks from receipt of donation.</b>

<em>CDS Global ensures all documents (including accompanying information) are scanned and stored electronically in Web-based image archives allowing for easy access and long-term safekeeping. This is done immediately upon the deposit of the check and is available immediately via our Web Image Archive. Deposits take place within 24 hours of delivery to CDS Global.</em>

What is the industry standard as to how secure nonprofitsâ€™ financial information is:

â€¢ Are nonprofitsâ€™ audits SAS 70 compliant?

â€¢ Are nonprofitsâ€™ credit card processing system considered PCI compliant?

â€¢ Are nonprofits compliant with SOX (Sarbanes Oxley legislation)?
<ol>
	<li>Yes to all questions.</li>

<div class="submit_answer">Check Answer</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer6" style="display: none;">

<b>Correct Answer: B. On average nonprofits are only 50% compliant with SAS 70, PCI, and SOX legislation.</b>

What is the industry norm for the level of sophistication of donor acknowledgements?

Do nonprofits use variable data elements?

Do nonprofits provide different acknowledgements for different donors based on their likes, dislikes or gift sizes?
<ol>
	<li class="answer_correct">Acknowledgements are personalized within the salutation/greeting and one other location.</li>

How do nonprofits typically fulfill their event prizes?

â€¢ Are they picked &amp; packed and then mailed from an office?

â€¢ Are they outsourcing the services?

â€¢ What are the general postal discounts nonprofits receive?
<ol>
	<li>Ordered, packed, and shipped from professional warehousing and fulfillment services.</li>
	<li class="answer_correct">Orders are packed and shipped from local offices around the organization.</li>
	<li>Some orders are packed and shipped inhouse, and other through a professional fulfillment service.</li>
</ol>
<div class="submit_answer">Check Answer</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer8" style="display: none;">

<b>Correct Answer: B. Orders are typically picked, packed and shipped from the organization's local offices, taking away valuable staff time and failing to take advantage of postal volumes.</b>

<em>CDS Global provides the process of picking, packing and shipping from their professional warehousing and fulfillment systems, which saves on time, mistakes, and largely on postage beyond simple nonprofit rates (usually 10 cents to several dollars per piece due to the large volumes of mail being sent.)</em>

Do nonprofits typically market with blanket form letters, or do they target their marketing programs through personalized, multichannel means?
<ol>
	<li>Marketing is targeted to fewer prospects that are more likely to donate. A full 360 degree view of each donor is leveraged to target the correct donors with the most applicable information and with the style of solicitation most likely to draw interest.</li>

</ol>
<div class="submit_answer">Check Answer</div>
<div class="answer" id="answer9" style="display: none;">

<b>Correct Answer: B. Usually, nonprofit marketing is done in a blanket approach with an effort to get in front of as many prospects as possible. Some segmentation of donors by donation level, gender and age occurs but often only to cut prospect lists to manageable numbers, not to create separate pieces specific to those segments. Stories are told to draw the interest of the donor and a simple ask is made for either a reply donation or a web donation or to sign up for an event.</b>

<em>CDS Globalâ€™s marketing solutions for nonprofits are targeted to fewer prospects that are more likely to donate. A full 360 degree view of each donor is leveraged to target the correct donors with the most applicable information and the style of solicitation most likely to draw interest. Our marketing solutions seek to build personal interactive relationships between the organization and the donor. The goal is to not only tells stories to draw the interest of the donor but to create an immediate and intuitive call to action that results in an immediate donation. Our multichannel approach uses direct mail, email, personalized URLs and microsites to solicit the donor on several different levels in succession.</em>
